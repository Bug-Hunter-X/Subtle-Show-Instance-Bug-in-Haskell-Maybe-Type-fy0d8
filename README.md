This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the `Show` instance declaration for the Haskell `Maybe` type. The provided code defines custom `Show` and `Eq` instances for `Maybe a`. While this works correctly for basic types, it can behave unexpectedly when dealing with complex types or custom `Show` instances.  The `bug.hs` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.hs` file offers a corrected implementation.
